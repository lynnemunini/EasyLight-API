# EasyLight API

This is a Flask application and serves as an API for the [EasyLight](https://github.com/lynnemunini/EasyLight) app.
The API fetches details from the Android app during registration and updates the database.
When the user wants to login to the EasyLight app, the API fetches the user's details from the database and checks if they match the details provided by the user.
If successful, the user will be redirected to the EasyLight app.
